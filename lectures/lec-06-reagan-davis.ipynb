    "\n",
    "* Readings\n",
    "    * See schedule on GitHub\n",
    "* **Response posts.** See Canvas for schedule and instructions. \n",
    "    * For next week (NetIDs `a*-g*`), Moretti's article (via Canvas)\n",
    "    * The readings themselves are *always* required. Read every week. Respond only as scheduled.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Why group these articles?\n",
    "  * They both use basic dictionary methods to produce interesting results.\n",
    "  * Contrast between them helps to illustrate the importance of having an interesting *idea* behind your research task.\n",
    "  * We'll do something (semi)related for the next problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reagan et al., \"The emotional arcs of stories\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the authors' goal? What are they trying to find or prove?\n",
    "* What is the corpus? Is it appropriate to the task?\n",
    "* Walk me through this schematic of the method ...\n",
    "![](images/lec-06-reagan-figure.png)\n",
    "* How should we evaluate the importance of the \"discovery\" that there are 6 (or 5 or 7) \"universal\" \"emotional arcs\" in \"stories\"? (think about why this question involves so many scare quotes).\n",
    "  * How do you think about the relationship between novelty/outliers and convention/central tendencies? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Erin Davis (and Liana Sposto), \"The Physical Traits that Define Men and Women in Literature\" (for section on Friday)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the corpus and what are the methods applied in this study?\n",
    "  * Are both of those elements well justified?\n",
    "* What are the social/readerly effects of the representational differences Davis identifies?\n",
    "* Does the format of the essay work for you? \n",
    "  * Would you like to see more like this (in the field, not just our class)?\n",
    "  * Why do you imagine that there *aren't* more such \"visual essays\" in the professional literature?"
